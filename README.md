# Spotify-Uncovered
This is a project I developed to learn React, it's a spotify stats application similar to the end of year spotify wrapped, however it is accessible at any point of the year.

You can try out the app here (you must have a spotify account to sign in with): https://jacoba2000.github.io/Spotify-Uncovered/
